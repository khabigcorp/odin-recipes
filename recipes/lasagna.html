        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the most popular lasagna recipe on Allrecipes, submitted by John Chandler over 20 years ago. You can easily customize the ingredient list to suit your needs. The ground beef combined with the sweet Italian sausage is so good that you will never want to eat instant lasagna again. We recommend pairing it with garlic bread and salad.</p>
